# ObjeX Roadmap

---

## Completed

### Content-Addressable Blob Storage ✅
- `IHashService` interface in `ObjeX.Core` (BCL only, no NuGet)
- `Sha256HashService` in `ObjeX.Infrastructure/Hashing/` — SHA256 of `"{bucket}/{key}"`, 64-char lowercase hex
- `FileSystemStorageService` stores blobs at `{basePath}/{bucket}/{L1}/{L2}/{hash}.blob`
  - L1/L2 = first 4 hex chars → 65,536 directories, even distribution
  - Logical key (virtual path) lives in DB only — no filesystem folders for virtual paths
- `IHashService` registered as singleton in `Program.cs`

### Hangfire Background Jobs ✅
- `Hangfire.Core` + `Hangfire.AspNetCore` + `Hangfire.Storage.SQLite` (reuses `objex.db`)
- Job classes in `ObjeX.Infrastructure/Jobs/` — no job logic in API layer
- `CleanupOrphanedBlobsJob` — weekly Sunday 03:00 UTC, returns `CleanupResult` (checked/deleted/duration/timestamp) visible in Hangfire dashboard history
- `VerifyBlobIntegrityJob` — weekly Sunday 04:00 UTC, recomputes MD5 of every blob and compares against stored ETag; logs errors for corrupted/missing blobs; returns `IntegrityResult`
- Dashboard at `/hangfire` — Admin role required (localhost bypassed for dev)
- `IMetadataService.ListAllObjectsAsync()` added for cross-bucket object enumeration

### Blazor UI ✅
- Radzen Blazor component library, Inter font (self-hosted), teal brand theme via CSS variable overrides
- **Dashboard** (`/`) — stat cards (buckets, objects, storage, avg size), storage/objects/file-type charts with tooltips, bucket table with share bars (10s auto-refresh)
- **Buckets page** (`/buckets`) — list all buckets, create (with inline name validation), delete with confirmation
- **Bucket detail / file browser** (`/buckets/{name}`) — virtual folder nav, breadcrumb, upload into current folder, per-object download (via S3 port 9000), delete, ZIP download
- **Drag-and-drop upload dialog** — multi-file picker, streams files to `IObjectStorageService` directly from Blazor (no API round-trip)
- **Settings page** (`/settings`) — S3 credential management (create with one-time secret display, list, delete) + dark/light mode toggle
- **Profile page** (`/profile`) — username, email, password management with inline validation
- Toast notifications bottom-right via Radzen `NotificationService`

### CI/CD ✅
- **CI** (`ci.yml`) — triggers on push to `main` and all PRs; runs on `ubuntu-latest`; restore → build Release; fails fast on compile errors; no tests yet
- **CD** (`cd.yml`) — triggers on push to `main`; builds multi-arch image (amd64/arm64) and pushes to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/centrolabs/objex:latest` + `ghcr.io/centrolabs/objex:<tag>`)

### Dockerize ✅
- Multi-stage Dockerfile (SDK build → ASP.NET runtime)
- Multi-arch via `--platform=$BUILDPLATFORM` + `$TARGETARCH`
- `docker-compose.yml` with named volume for `/data`
- Environment variables for connection string and blob path baked into image defaults
- Published to GitHub Container Registry: `ghcr.io/centrolabs/objex:latest`

### Virtual Folder Navigation ✅
- `ListObjectsResult` record in `ObjeX.Core/Models/` — `Objects` + `CommonPrefixes`
- `IMetadataService.ListObjectsAsync` accepts optional `prefix` and `delimiter` — prefix filter pushed to DB (`LIKE`), delimiter grouping in C#
- API list endpoint accepts `?prefix=&delimiter=` query params; returns `{ objects, commonPrefixes }`
- `GET /api/objects/{bucket}/download?prefix=` — streams ZIP of all objects under a prefix
- Blazor `Objects.razor` — unified file+folder grid, breadcrumb, New Folder button, folder delete (recursive), folder ZIP download, upload into current prefix
- Placeholder objects (key ends with `/`, `ContentType: application/x-directory`) used for empty folders; filtered from file rows in UI

### Dark Mode ✅
- System preference detected via `prefers-color-scheme` on first visit (inline `<script>` in `<head>`)
- Cookie `objex-theme` persists choice across sessions
- `App.razor` reads cookie server-side via `IHttpContextAccessor` → passes to `<RadzenTheme>` — no flash on load
- `ThemeService` (Radzen) registered as `AddScoped<ThemeService>()` — drives client-side switching
- Toggle (`RadzenSwitch`) in Settings page; initial state read from cookie via JS in `OnAfterRenderAsync`

### Atomic Blob Writes ✅
- `FileSystemStorageService.StoreAsync` writes to `{hash}.blob.tmp` then `File.Move(..., overwrite: true)` — atomic on Linux
- On exception, `.tmp` file deleted in `catch` — final path never touched
- Startup cleanup: `.tmp` files older than 1 hour deleted automatically, count logged

### Authentication & Authorization ✅
- **ASP.NET Core Identity** — `User` extends `IdentityUser`, `ObjeXDbContext` extends `IdentityDbContext<User>`
- **Roles** — `Admin` and `User` seeded on first startup
- **Default admin** — `admin` / `admin` (configurable via `DefaultAdmin:*` config keys; warned in logs)
- **Login UI** — `/login` page with Radzen styling, username-or-email support, error toast, auth guard (redirects to `/` if already logged in)
- **Logout** — `GET /account/logout` clears cookie, redirects to `/login`
- **Global Blazor protection** — `AuthorizeView` in `MainLayout.razor` wraps all pages; `Login.razor` uses `EmptyLayout` to opt out
- **Cookie auth for browser** — default scheme is `Identity.Application`; challenges redirect to `/login`
- **AWS Signature V4 for S3 clients** — `SigV4AuthMiddleware` on port 9000; validates HMAC-SHA256 canonical request, timestamp freshness (±15 min), payload hash; presigned URL expiry enforced via `X-Amz-Expires`
- **S3 credentials model** — `S3Credential` in `ObjeX.Core/Models/`; `AccessKeyId` ("OBX" + 17 random chars) + `SecretAccessKey` (40-byte base64url, stored plain for HMAC); `Create()` factory returns secret once
- **S3 credentials UI** — Settings page lists credentials, create (one-time secret display with copy button), delete
- **Proper 401 for API paths** — `ConfigureApplicationCookie` suppresses redirect for `/api/*`; `UseStatusCodePagesWithRedirects` skipped for `/api/*`
- **Hangfire dashboard** — `HangfireAuthorizationFilter` allows localhost unconditionally; requires `Admin` role otherwise

## Phase 1 — Infrastructure ✅ Complete

---

## Phase 2 — S3 Compatibility & Large Files

### 2. S3 API Compatibility 🚧 In Progress
- [x] S3-style routes on dedicated port 9000: `GET /`, `HEAD/PUT/DELETE /{bucket}`, `PUT/GET/HEAD/DELETE /{bucket}/{*key}`
- [x] XML response formatting via `S3Xml` helper (`SecurityElement.Escape()` for injection prevention)
- [x] S3 error code constants (`S3Errors` class)
- [x] `?download=true` query param forces `application/octet-stream` attachment (cross-origin download fix)
- [x] AWS Signature V4 authentication — `SigV4Parser`, `SigV4Signer`, `SigV4AuthMiddleware`; canonical request, timestamp replay protection, presigned URL expiry, payload hash verification
- [x] `aws-chunked` streaming — `STREAMING-*` payload hash bypassed in `SigV4AuthMiddleware`; outer request signature still verified
- [x] `ListObjects` (V1) and `ListObjectsV2` (`?list-type=2`) with prefix + delimiter support; `continuation-token` and `start-after` echoed back for client compatibility
- [x] S3 error response XML format for all error cases — all errors via `S3Xml.Error()` consistently
- [x] Compatibility testing with `aws-cli` — verified uploads, downloads, multipart, presigned URLs
- [x] S3 POST Object — browser-based uploads via presigned POST policy (form-field auth, `POST /{bucket}` + `POST /` bucketEndpoint mode)
- [x] DeleteObjects (batch delete) — `POST /{bucket}?delete` with XML key list; used by `aws s3 rm --recursive` and `aws s3 sync --delete`
- [x] Startup seeding of S3 credentials and buckets via config/env vars (zero-UI integration setup)
- [ ] POST Object: `${filename}` variable substitution in key — deferred (no modern SDK uses this)
- [ ] POST Object: `success_action_redirect` / `success_action_status` — deferred (all SDKs use default 204)
- [x] `x-amz-meta-*` custom metadata — stored as JSON on BlobObject, returned on GET/HEAD, captured on PUT/POST Object

### 3. Multipart Upload ✅
- [x] `POST /{bucket}/{key}?uploads` — InitiateMultipartUpload
- [x] `PUT /{bucket}/{key}?partNumber={n}&uploadId={id}` — UploadPart
- [x] `POST /{bucket}/{key}?uploadId={id}` — CompleteMultipartUpload
- [x] `DELETE /{bucket}/{key}?uploadId={id}` — AbortMultipartUpload
- [x] Temporary part storage under `_multipart/{uploadId}/{partNumber}.part`
- [x] Part ETag tracking (MD5 per part, multipart ETag format `md5-{partCount}`)
- [x] Atomic final object assembly (tmp → move)
- [x] 5 GB+ file support (no size limit beyond disk space)
- [x] Range request support — `enableRangeProcessing: true` fixes AWS CLI parallel downloads
- [x] Weekly Hangfire job cleans abandoned uploads older than 7 days (`CleanupAbandonedMultipartJob`)

### 4. Presigned URLs ✅
- [x] HMAC-SHA256 signed GET URLs with configurable expiry
- [x] Expiry enforcement on every request (`X-Amz-Expires` in `SigV4AuthMiddleware`)
- [x] `PresignedUrlGenerator` in `ObjeX.Core.Utilities` — pure BCL, usable from both Api and Web
- [x] `GET /api/presign/{bucket}/{*key}?expires=N` endpoint (cookie auth, port 9001)
- [x] Copy-link button in Blazor UI — opens duration picker dialog, copies URL to clipboard
- [x] Duration picker: quick-select chips + custom number/unit input, live expiry preview
- [x] Default and max expiry configurable via `S3:PresignedUrlDefaultExpirySeconds` / `S3:PresignedUrlMaxExpirySeconds`
- [ ] PUT presigned URLs (direct browser upload without credentials) — deferred

## Phase 3 — UI & Object Model Enhancements

### 5. Enhanced Blazor UI
- ~~Image and PDF inline previews~~ ✅ — eye button opens dialog; supports image, video, audio, PDF, text
- ~~Bulk select: delete multiple~~ ✅ — checkbox column, bulk delete + ZIP download, action bar
- Mobile-responsive layout
- ~~File metadata viewer (content-type, ETag, size, dates)~~ ✅ — info button opens dialog with key, content-type, size, ETag, uploaded, last modified
- ~~Storage analytics charts (per-bucket breakdown: storage donut, objects column, file types donut — top-N limits, custom tooltips)~~ ✅ — usage over time deferred (requires historical data)
- ~~Folder navigation~~ ✅, ~~Dark mode~~ ✅, ~~ZIP download~~ ✅

### 6. Object Metadata & Tags
- Key-value tags per object (stored in DB)
- Tag-based search and filtering
- Tag management UI
- Lifecycle policies based on tags (e.g. auto-delete after X days)
- Retention policy enforcement

### 7. Advanced Search
- Full-text filename search
- Filter by content-type, size range, date range
- Tag-based filtering
- Faceted search UI
- Saved searches and search history

---

## Phase 4 — Multi-User & Permissions

### 8. Storage Quotas
- `User.StorageUsedBytes` is tracked but not enforced — decorative until quota enforcement is wired in
- Add `StorageQuotaBytes` to `User` model (nullable = unlimited)
- Check `StorageUsedBytes + incomingSize > StorageQuotaBytes` before accepting upload — return 413 with clear message
- Admin UI to set per-user quota
- Verify `StorageUsedBytes` is correctly updated on upload and delete before enforcing

### 10. User Management UI
- Identity backend already implemented (User model, roles, password hashing)
- Registration page
- Admin user list (view, deactivate, role assignment)
- Password reset flow (requires real email sender — currently no-op)
- Email verification

### 11. Bucket Permissions
- Per-bucket access control list (ACL)
- Read / Write / Delete permissions per user
- Permission management UI (admin)
- Permission checks enforced in all API endpoints

### 12. Teams & Organizations
- Multi-tenant support with organization workspaces
- Team membership (Owner / Admin / Member roles)
- Per-organization storage quotas
- Team invitation flow
- Org-scoped bucket and object isolation

---

## Phase 5 — Testing & Hardening

### 13. Automated Test Suite

CI is currently build-only. Before production-ready claim, need:

**Integration tests (real SQLite, no mocks):**
- Upload → download round-trip with ETag verification
- Upload → delete → confirm 404
- Bucket CRUD lifecycle
- Auth boundary: no key, expired key, wrong key, valid cookie, valid API key
- Path traversal fuzzing on object keys (`../`, `..\\`, URL-encoded variants)
- Concurrent uploads to same key (race condition validation)
- Large file streaming (500MB+)

**Fault injection:**
- Disk full mid-upload — confirm `.tmp` cleaned, 500 returned, no partial state
- Corrupt blob file — current: returns corrupt bytes with 200; target: detect via ETag mismatch on read
- Missing blob with valid metadata — confirm 404, not 500
- `SQLITE_BUSY` simulation under concurrent write load

**Operational:**
- Backup and restore drill — stop, backup, wipe, restore, verify `/health/ready` + spot-check downloads
- Hangfire GC job triggered manually — verify orphaned blobs removed, metadata-backed blobs untouched

### 14. ETag Verification on Read — Deferred

`VerifyBlobIntegrityJob` (weekly) is the primary integrity mechanism for v1.0 — it covers silent corruption before users hit it. Re-hashing on every read is a performance regression for large files (10GB = ~20s CPU before first byte).

Planned approach:
- **v1.0** — weekly job covers it ✅ (already exists)
- **v1.1** — opt-in `x-objex-verify-integrity: true` request header; re-hash before streaming, return 500 if mismatch; zero overhead for normal clients
- **v1.2** — streaming MD5 passthrough on all reads, log mismatches silently, expose corruption counters on `/health/integrity`

---

## Phase 7 — Storage Extensibility

### 15. Storage Backends
- Implement additional `IObjectStorageService` backends (cloud, chunked, etc.)
- Swap in without changing any other layer

### 16. PostgreSQL Support
- Swap SQLite for PostgreSQL via same `IMetadataService` interface
- Configuration-driven backend selection

---

## Future Considerations

- Unicode key normalization — macOS clients upload with NFD normalization, Linux with NFC; the same filename produces different SHA256 hashes and is stored as two separate objects. Fix: normalize all keys to NFC on ingest
- Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint — `prometheus-net.AspNetCore`; expose request rates, upload/download counts, storage used, active connections; enables Grafana dashboards
- Backup tooling — `export` / `restore` CLI commands; scheduled backup to local path or remote (S3, rclone)
- Metadata rebuild from disk — currently impossible; would require storing the logical key alongside the blob (e.g. in a sidecar file or blob header), then scanning blobs to reconstruct `objex.db` after total DB loss
- Hangfire on separate SQLite file — reduces lock contention between job store and EF Core under write-heavy load
- OAuth / SSO (Google, GitHub, OIDC)
- Content-based search (Elasticsearch integration)
- Image recognition / auto-tagging (ML)
- Object versioning
- Lifecycle policies: auto-delete after X days
- Replication and redundancy
- Kubernetes Helm charts
- CDN integration
- Migration tools from S3 / MinIO
- Compliance: audit logs, encryption at rest
