# Changelog

All notable changes to ObjeX are documented here.

---

## Unreleased

- PostgreSQL as opt-in database backend (`DATABASE_PROVIDER=postgresql`)
- Audit log — records bucket/object operations with user, action, timestamp; Admin-only UI at `/audit`
- Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint with per-bucket storage gauges
- Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment
- Storage quota enforcement (per-user and global default)
- ETag integrity verification on read — opt-in `x-objex-verify-integrity: true` header re-hashes blob before streaming
- Automated test suite — 113 xUnit tests (unit + integration), CI runs tests on every push and PR

### Fixed
- BucketNameValidator rejected bucket names starting/ending with digits (`char.IsLower` → `char.IsLower || char.IsAsciiDigit`)
- Duplicate bucket creation returned 500 instead of S3-standard 409 `BucketAlreadyExists`
- SigV4 auth missing role claims — Admin/Manager privileges now enforced via S3 API (not just Blazor)
- Concurrent uploads to same key could fail with IOException due to `.tmp` file collision (now uses unique temp filenames)

## v0.2.0 — 2026-03-31

### Added
- S3 POST Object (presigned POST via form-field auth)
- S3 DeleteObjects batch delete (`POST /{bucket}?delete`)

- Bucket ownership — users see only their own buckets; Admin/Manager see all
- ListObjectsV2 (`?list-type=2`) with continuation token support
